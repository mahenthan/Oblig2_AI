In this this assignment i chose the TESLA stock use case. Here it seems to be more appropriate to use the regression technique. We are working on predictiong contionuous numerical values. On the other hand the classification algorithm would be usefull in cases where you categorice the data to labels or classes. One of the common regression algorithms used would be Linear Regression which is used here.
